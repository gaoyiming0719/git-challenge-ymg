I had absolutely zero knowledge about Git or version control before this project. Now I think I understand how Git takes “snapshots” of working history and allow developing different versions at the same time. I also know what branches and commits are and am comfortable working with them. I am also confident in checking directories and comparing different commits using command line arguments. However, I think I need more practice on working with remotes. I am not very confident about when to save a local copy and how to merge local commits with remotes. I also don’t really know how to trouble-shoot when something goes wrong, except for going to the office hours.
